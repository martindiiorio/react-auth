### React & Redux exercise for learn Auth 

**First Task**
```
The HOME page currently has two components, "TopBar" and "HomeContent."

There is a "Login" button in each. Your first task is to implement the "Login" buttons so that clicking on either one logs you in.

When logged in, both buttons should change to "Logout" and clicking on either should revert you to logged out state. The TopBar Login button should change to YOUR initials (see example below) and the Signup button should change to Logout. 
```
**Second Task**
```
Create a route for a users list; name your component "UserList."

Use https://randomuser.me/ to get the 20 users and display them in a list on the page.The properties to be shown in the list items should be:
First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone.

When the user list is displayed, clicking of any user item, the app should navigate to the user detail route (screen); name your component "UserDatail" component. This user details page would be dynamic - the url should contain the user id while navigating to the user detail page.

There should be a back button on the user detail page so the end-user can go back to the user listing page. The properties to show on the user details are:
Picture, First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone
